#About BitcoinZH
BitcoinZH is a bridge between Bitcoin communities in China & the West.

It was created following [this post on Reddit][Reddit post discussing Chinese Bitcoin translations].

You'll find translations of Bitcoin-related discussion in Chinese media and forums.

If you have a Bitcoin-related text you'd like translated into Chinese or English, for example a White Paper in the run up to a conference, you can submit a Pull Request to have it featured here.
