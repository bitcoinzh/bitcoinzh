###The Bitcoin Classic code's been released! Has anyone in China started using it?

![Who's upgraded to Bitcoin Classic?, original Chinese text from 8btc.com]({{ '/images/translations/has-anyone-upgraded-to-bitcoin-classic/2016-01-30-has-anyone-upgraded-to-bitcoin-classic.jpg' | prepend: site.url }})

As the title says, the code is open sourced now, has anyone in China started using it? What's the attitude of the big mining pools?

http://xtnodes.com/

You can see the number of nodes on each network on this website, and the number of blocks mined by miners on each network.

###ls-a:

...the official Classic site is at https://bitcoinclassic.com/, I certainly haven't started using it. The link you posted is to XT nodes.

Gavin's sticking to his guns. He won't support the 90% consensus/2MB proposal by our mining industry, and even puts out his own fork that, with just 75% consensus, risks dividing the network just like XT did.

So it seems Chinese mining pools are resisting him until he joins in their support for 90% consensus and 2MB blocks.

The address OP gave was just fine:

405 XT nodes     113 BU nodes     48 Classic nodes     4896 Other nodes

The latter includes votes cast from QT nodes.

I'm waiting for a Windows client then I'll install it.

The number of nodes upgrading is pretty quick, 50 in one day:

Putting this out there may well be the only way to accurately test the truth.

Individual nodes aren't worth looking at. Firstly, they're providing very little in terms of costs, and secondly they could just be imitating Classic nodes. Even if Classic passes Core in support, we still won't know exactly which user is using which version.
