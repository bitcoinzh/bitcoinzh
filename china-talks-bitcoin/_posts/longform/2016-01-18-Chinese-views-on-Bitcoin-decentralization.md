###"Core developer announces Bitcoin's failure and sells bitcoin. Now Bitcoin is controlled by China." How do you see it?

By Ayu, formerly of BTCC and BTC38

The reason Mike Hearn made such a statement is likely due to BTC XT, which he worked on.

The XT project was originally to address the block size limit, which is increasingly a limiting factor as the transaction volume increases. This is the reason core developers demanded to raise the limit from 1MB to 8MB. Coincidentally, such a raise would also raise costs for miners, ergo the objection from the mining pools. It just so happened that many of the pools and miners are in China.

There are competing proposals concerning block size expansion. Aside from XT's 8MB, there is one for 20MB; Bobby Lee, CEO at BTCC, proposed it be raised first to 2MB and then to 4MB; some members of the community argued that the block size should be adjusted dynamically.

It is hard to determine whether or not XT's 8MB is the most reasonable of all proposals, but it gained extra authority from the fact that its developers were some of the most senior in the community. This authority, however, was at odds with what BTC supposedly stands for - decentralization. As the major mining pools refused to adopt it, the project flopped.

I remember in 2012, Bitcoin experienced a similar crisis. At that time, the Bitcoin Foundation still had enough authority to influence the community. It responded promptly and released a new version, which won the support of the majority of pools. As a result, the problem was solved in the end.

Commenting on this incident, the Foundation claimed that mining pools act as an intermediary between miners and users, alleviating the shortcomings in decentralization, holding the system together and improving its efficiency. When I saw this comment, I was a bit surprised. Isn't Bitcoin supposed to be decentralized? If so, why should a small number of players be allowed to call the shots?

We have moved on since then. The small-scale, home miners have been replaced by those who traveled far and wide in the pursuit of cheaper electricity and cheaper rent. As a result, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin diminished. The entire community, divided in the face of crisis, split while haggling over utility and cost. When geeks confront businessmen, the current situation may be inevitable.

I agree with Mike Hearn on at least one thing, which is that Bitcoin is an experiment. The value of this experiment is that the technology is decentralized (at least it was at the beginning). In the past, we took it for granted that decentralization meant inefficiency. Today, this doctrine is challenged by technological advances. When Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, many called it anarchism. It's clear that by now that anarchy has descended into a system of representation - so much for social evolution.

###ppip:

Oh I remember now. That did happen.

###Cao Lianzhi:

It really is a bit similar to representative system

###Anonymous user:

Concentrated democracy

###Wild Wind Boy:

The decline of decentralization...

###Xin Song:

People need to be led after all

###Zi Ming:

The advantages will add up over time. This is the inevitable consequence of social development

###Wei Zhenghao:

Very good analogy

###Lin Weixun:

This evolution of Bitcoin is a good social experiment. The reality proves that anarchism can only exist on a limited scale. It is very difficult for it to survive in a completely open environment.

###Wang Siyu:

Sigh

###Anonymous user:

Bitcoin is a perfect social experiment

###Yang:

Very interesting

###Lagesi:

Damn, I can't understand what he's saying at all

###PENGYIWANG:

This developer is not a core developer and he's only committed three fixes, which ranks him #89.

###PENGYIWANG:

Bitcoin has been pronounced dead 89 times since its birth

###Bashan Yiye Chuyu Jiao:

What a pile of bullshit. I still can't see how it's different to a pyramid scheme. For computers it's constant processing, for mankind it's gambling. It is a game. A game of money.

###Lv Xiliang:

The Way of Heaven is to give the excesses to those who lack; the Way of Man is the opposite.

###jiang will:

Cloud computing is the future of the internet. Bitcoin mining may evolve into globally unified cloud computing. The entire world would be one huge mine with one giant miner based on a script. This will solve the centralization problem.

###Kuangnanfeng (in response to jiang will):

This is complete centralization. The only mine would be the central bank of Bitcoin, responsible for verification, documentation and distribution of bitcoin.
