**Jack Ma will be weeping. The decentralized Taobao, Openbazaar, is in beta release!**

The decentralized Taobao, Openbazaar will be among Bitcoin's first killer apps, if not the first.

A look at the video of the beta edition shows the client is already very complete, with product uploads, payments, delivery address and more. Everything you need...

This factor is beyond Bitcoin.

The key is to truly allow buyers and sellers to communicate. Quit wasting time, learn how to open a store, become an OpenBazaar merchant and decorate your store.

What I want to know is how counterfeits, returns, fake reviews and logistics are agreed. Since it's decentralized, where does the trust come from to go transact with a counterparty? Also, what advantages does it have over Taobao?

Seems there's still no official release then. This project has been ongoing for one or two years now, I don't know if there's a Chinese version.

You can sell drugs on it, it'll be blocked by the Great Firewall.

If it has good applications, Taobao can just upgrade to include these features, the technology isn't a problem.

At the end of day, Taobao is centralized. Will you just put up with the endless fees?

Why would you say that? Because it's not fully developed?

Couldn't these applications use smart contracts? I'm not too clear on the specifics either. The merchants should already have been in touch with the logistics providers. When Taobao just came out, didn't Jack Ma also let staff list and sell items?
